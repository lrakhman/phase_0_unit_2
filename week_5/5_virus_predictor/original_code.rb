# U2.W5: Virus Predictor

# I worked on this challenge by myself.

# This program is taking the STATE_DATA hash, which is made of keys and values (that are actually
# another hash), and using the info to calculate the effects that a virus has in each state.

# EXPLANATION OF require_relative
# When you use require to load a file, you are usually accessing functionality that has been properly installed, and made accessible, in your system. 
# require does not offer a good solution for loading files within the projectâ€™s code. This may be useful during a development phase, 
# for accessing test data, or even for accessing files that are "locked" away inside a project, not intended for outside use.
#

#BONUS: Access the population by calling it on the instance.
# I added attr_reader :population to make this possible.
